STILL UNDER TESTING AND ITERATION
Summary:
Integrates NVIDIA cuOpt into CortexFlow to optimize multi-agent decision-making.
It improves task scheduling and resource allocation for AI-driven workflows.

TODO:
1. Define task allocation strategies for AI agents.
2. Load and process multi-agent workflow data.
3. Integrate cuOpt for task scheduling optimization.
4. Implement constraint-based optimization for AI collaboration.
5. Evaluate efficiency improvements with different stress levels.
6. Ensure compatibility with TensorRT-accelerated models.
7. Benchmark workflow efficiency before and after optimization.
8. Implement logging for execution time and resource allocation.
9. Deploy optimized workflow in CortexFlow.
10. Write unit tests to validate optimization results.
