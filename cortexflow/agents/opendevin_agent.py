# Summary:
# This module implements the OpenDevin agent, which is responsible for
# workflow optimization in the stress-productivity simulation. It identifies
# patterns in cognitive metrics over time, matches them to recognized workflow
# issues, and recommends targeted optimization strategies based on the current
# task type and stress level. The agent helps improve productivity by suggesting
# evidence-based workflow adjustments.
